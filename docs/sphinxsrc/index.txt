Welcome to SFLvault's documentation!
====================================

Here you will find the documentation to script your access to the SFLvault.

Before we start, here is a quick mapping of the elements::


   SFLvault command line                            SQLite database
       |                                                  |
       |                                                  |
  SFLvaultClient object ---> (direct access) ---> SFLvaultAccess object
        \                                                /
         \ (wraps)                                      /
          \                                            /
       XMLRPCClient  ---> (network) ----> XMLRPCController 


The :class:`sflvault.client.SFLvaultClient` methods are called when you run
``sflvault connect s#1`` or ``sflvault service-add ...``.
Two other objects enter into composition when calling from the command line:
:class:`sflvault.client.SFLvaultCommand` and
:class:`sflvault.client.SFLvaultShell` (if you launched the shell
with ``sflvault`` alone).

SFLvaultCommand deals with all the options parsing, and calls methods on the
underlying SFLvaultClient object.

Communication to the Vault is done through XML-RPC via the server's XML-RPC
controller, through the use of the client's xmlrpc library. This gives a quite
direct access to the SFLvaultAccess object on the server-side, while wrapping
calls when an authentication mechanism.

SFLvault was designed to be able to by-pass the XML-RPC parts, and connect
the SFLvaultClient directly to the SFLvaultAccess object, when working locally.

.. NOTE::

  This hasn't been tested yet, but not much work would be required to make
  that happen.
