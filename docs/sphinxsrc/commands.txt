SFLvaultCommand object
======================

The ``SFLvaultCommand`` object is invoked by the shell manager, or when
executing ``sflvault`` on the command line.  All methods of the object will be
used to generate help, and will parse command-line arguments on it's own.

.. NOTE::

  To learn more of the security impact of these functions, please check
  :class:`sflvault.lib.vault.SFLvaultAccess` which is the piece of code
  that does the actual work.  This class only wraps calls to that library
  (directly by importing the Python class, or over the network via XML-RPC)

.. Commented imports

   >>> import sflvault.client

.. autoclass:: sflvault.client.SFLvaultCommand
   :members:


SFLvaultShell object
====================

This shell object wraps multiple :class:`SFLvaultCommand` objects in a
shell-like command-line prompt.
