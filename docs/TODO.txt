TODO
====

 * Add versioning capabilities for all changes (à-la Typo3)
 * Add support for svlfault ssh -L, -R, and -D, which does
   everything it can (even over multiple-hops) to create the
   desired tunnel (Local, Remote and SOCKS proxy): for example,
   create intermediate -L with random ports to make sure
   everything gets to destination.
 * Add table for sensitive data, that isn't server-related (like
   credit card info, PayPal accounts..)
 * Make sflvault --shell ask for the passphrase and decrypt the private
   key once, and be able to work in with a decrypted (in-ram encrypted)
   private key, so all the operations are made with the same private key.
   Eventually, dropping the key each 3 minutes of inactivity writing to
   the term: [Dropped secrets from memory], asking to authenticate again:
     [sflv]% 
     SFLvault: dropped secrets from memory. Issue 'pass' to log back in.
     [sflv]% pass
     Enter passphrase: 
     Authenticated, timeout in XXX seconds
     [sflv]%
 * Throttle, avec avertissement.. y repenser..
 * Sécurisation HTTPS, vérification des certificats, MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE
   attach, garder le fingerprint, etc...
