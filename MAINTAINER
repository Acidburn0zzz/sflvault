Steps to perform when releasing SFLvault
========================================

Temporary instructions: SFLVault's release process is in the middle of a big overhaul. For now, we
limit ourselves to PyPI release.

* Modify setup.py and change the version number, for each of the components.

* Make sure the MINIMAL_CLIENT_VERSION in controllers/xmlrpc.py is appropriate,
  to ensure backwards compatibility.

* Commit the release commit INCLUDING the Release Notes inside that commit.
  Note all new features and fixes.

* Step OUTSIDE of the virtualenv, with `deactivate` (otherwise, your
  virtenv's path will go in the `sflvault` executable file)

* For each module, SFLvault-common, SFLvault-server, SFLvault-client and
  SFLvault-client-qt:
  
  $ for path in common client client-qt server
  do
    cd $path
    python setup.py sdist
    cd ..
  done

  If this works, then upload it:

  $ for path in common client client-qt server
  do
    cd $path
    python setup.py sdist upload
    cd ..
  done

* Tag the commit with the version number

* Push with tags:

  git push --tags
