Steps to perform when releasing SFLvault
========================================

* Modify setup.py and change the version number

* Make sure the MINIMAL_CLIENT_VERSION in controllers/xmlrpc.py is appropriate,
  to ensure backwards compatibility.

* Modify `common/sflvault/common/__init__.py` to HIDE deprecation warnings.

* Commit the release commit INCLUDING the Release Notes inside that commit.
  Note all new features and fixes.

* Update the debian/changelog with the same information as in the Release
  commit.

* Step OUTSIDE of the virtualenv, with `deactivate` (otherwise, your virtenv's path will go in the `sflvault` executable file)

* For each module, SFLvault-common, SFLvault-server, SFLvault-client and
  SFLvault-client-qt:
  
  $ python setup.py sdist 
  $ python setup.py sdist upload    # prepend "register" the first time

* Prepare the Debian packages:

  $ for path in common client client-qt
  do
    cd $path
    dpkg-buildpackage -kFDFE4451
  done
  $ 

* Upload Debian packages:

  $ cd ..
  $ dput ppa:savoirfairelinux/sflvault sflvault-client-qt_0.7.5dev_i386.changes


Update documentation
--------------------

* Modify the UpgradePath page with everything required to upgrade.

* Modify the wiki's front-page to announce it.
  Link to the commit as "Release notes"

* Tag the commit with the version number

* Push with tags:

  git push --tags

* Announce by other means, IRC, Freshmeat, Slashdot, etc...

* Have another commit to RE-ENABLE deprecation warnings for development.
