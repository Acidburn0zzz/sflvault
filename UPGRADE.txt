Upgrade procedures
==================

This is when you upgrade from an older version to a more recent version, and to
keep track of changes. Usually, inside an sqlite shell:

  $ sqlite3 vault-database.db

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ALTER TABLE services ADD url VARCHAR(250);

hmm... you're better off with a clean database, using SQLite.

ALTER TABLE services ADD parent_service_id INTEGER


UPGRADE TO 0.6.6:
-----------------

To upgrade to 0.6.6, you should rename the column `stuff` to `cryptsymkey`  in
the `userciphers` table. This is to have better semantics as suggested by
Yannick Gingras.
