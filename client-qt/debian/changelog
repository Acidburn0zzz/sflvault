sflvault-client-qt (0.7.8~ppa1) lucid; urgency=low

    * Released 0.7.8
    * Upgrading:
    ** When upgrading to this version, the password stored in your Keyring will be invalidated, since a new standard and Windows-compatible way to store the password.  You should search for domain "sflvault". Under Ubuntu, it's in the "network credentials" section.
    * Added 'content' protocol handler, which will store a blob of content as the service secret.
    * Added 'sflvault' protocol handler, which inherits 'content' (to store another vault's credentials)
    * Added support to add a port-forwarding as part of an alias
    * Major improvements to the QT client:
    ** Save password in QT client
    ** Main window remembers position and size
    ** Fixed #3682: password show error
    ** Added desktop file
    ** Merged in Microsoft Windows version compatibility (should work, but more testing is needed)
    ** Updated protocol window to split arguments from the executable.
    ** Simplified service config interface
    ** Better error handling
    ** Revamped info-dock for a service, machine and customer.
    ** Added support for metadata.
    * Added a minimal but important test suite
    * Results are now sorted when searching (by machine name, and service URL)
    * Added basic logging to the server
    * Added support for metadata, for each service, with the first key, "prompt", being used by the 'sudo://', 'su://', and 'ssh://' handlers, to detect the shell prompt you'll be waiting for.  For the cases where the provided regexp weren't matching your shell.  The value for "prompt" should be a regular expression.
